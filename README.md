# Ghost Inspector tests

This is a collection of selenium tests we use in Ghost Inspector which may be uploaded using their test upload feature. Ideally this would contain all our tests and be kept in sync with what is present in GI, but until an automated process is built for that, it will likely be a stale store of a subset of the tests we use.
